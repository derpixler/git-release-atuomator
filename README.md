# git-release-atuomator
Automated script for Git release tagging and creation of release branches for major and minor versions. Fetches latest Git tag and prompts user to update major, minor, or patch version. Creates new Git tag and release branch, e.g. "release/v1.1.0", and pushes it to the remote repository if no release branch is available.
